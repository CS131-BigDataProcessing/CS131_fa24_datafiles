To my dear John,

Oh John, how I wish I could undo all that has happened. 
I want nothing more than to love you 365 days and to make you happy 10x. 
I wish there were words to describe how much in love I am with you John. 
John, no matter how much I try to describe, I cannot find the words.

I have been calling you my Marshmallow Man because you have the softest, sweetest heart I have ever known. 
I'm not letting you go! 
I would be the biggest fool ever should I do that. 
John, you have spoiled me. 
You make me feel so special with your love. 
More than that, you have made me whole. 
Without you, I am incomplete; there is a great void in me. 
I dare not imagine life without you because the mere thought terrifies me.

You are my world, my life, and my love--always. 
You didn't just steal my heart; you are my heart, my soul, my friend.

There have been so many mistakes made, so many wrongs that cannot be undone. 
Oh, how I wish I had a magic wand and could take away all the pain I have caused my dear John. 
Let me make it right. 
Let me show you how much you mean to me. 
Please, give me another chance.

I love you so much. 
I can't lose you. 
I won't give up on us. 
I love you more than I can possibly tell you; let me show you. 
I promise I will love you like you ought to be loved--forever.

Forever yours,
Mary
